# üñ•Ô∏è Simple Terminal Made in JavaScript

A lightweight, embeddable terminal interface written in plain JavaScript. It simulates a command-line experience in the browser, complete with basic commands, command history, blinking cursor, and keyboard input.

The goal of this project isn't to create a fully working terminal with all features, rather a super simple terminal environment that can be added for fun anywhere, for whatever reason.

## ‚ú® Features

- Interactive terminal prompt
- Adding custom commands
- Command history (with arrow key navigation)
- Simulated blinking cursor
- Easily embeddable in any HTML page

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fbongcam/simple-js-terminal.git
